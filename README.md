# Backstage Dev Container Automation Plugin

## Development Bounty: Backstage Dev Container Automation Plugin

**Bounty Title:** Create a Backstage Dev Container Setup Automation Plugin with GPT-4 Turbo and 'Open in Daytona' Integration

**Reward:** $500 USD

**Description:**
We are seeking a talented developer or team to create a plugin for the [Backstage](https://backstage.spotify.com/) developer platform. This plugin should utilize Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) capabilities and offer a single-interface solution that leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo (or BYOLLM) for extensive context understanding. The core functionality is to analyze git repositories and automatically propose an optimized `.devcontainer` configuration to the user. It should also feature an 'Open in Daytona' button to enhance user experience with starting development environments.

**Objectives:**

- Develop a plugin compatible with the Backstage ecosystem.
- Integrate GPT-4 Turbo for intelligent analysis and configuration suggestions based on the repository contents.
- Implement BYOK including enhanced security and privacy.
- Provide a single interface for all operations, including AI prompt interactions.
- Include an 'Open in Daytona' feature for easy access and contributions. Admin can set the URL of their Daytona instance on which this button will append “/#git-repo-url” (e.g. https://daytona.io/#https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp)

**Submission Details:**

- Fork the designated GitHub repository and submit your plugin as a pull request.
- Provide detailed documentation on setup, usage, and any configuration options.
- Include a video demo of the plugin in action.
- Ensure the code is well-commented and adheres to clean code practices.

**Selection Criteria:**

- Functionality and adherence to the project scope.
- Code quality, readability, and use of best practices.
- Documentation clarity and comprehensiveness.
- Ease of use and user interface design.
- The overall quality of the user experience.

**Deadline for Submissions:** 20.12.2023.

We're excited to see your approach to making Backstage setup effortless and intelligent.
