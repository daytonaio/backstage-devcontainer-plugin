**Description:**
We are seeking a talented developer to create a [plugin](https://backstage.io/plugins) for the [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) developer platform. This plugin should utilize Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) principle and offer a single-interface solution that leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo (or BYOLLM) for extensive context understanding. The core functionality is to analyze users git repositories and automatically propose an optimized `.devcontainer` configuration to the user.

- Implement BYOK, including enhanced security and privacy.
- Provide a single interface for all operations, including AI prompt interactions.
- Include an 'Open in Daytona' feature for easy access and contributions. Admin can set the URL of their Daytona instance on which this button will append “/#git-repo-url” (e.g. https://daytona.io/#https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp)

**Submission Details:**

- Fork the [this](https://github.com/daytonaio/backstage-devcontainer-plugin/) GitHub repository and submit your plugin as a pull request.
- Provide detailed README on setup, usage, and any configuration options.
